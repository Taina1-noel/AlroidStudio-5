## 🎯 Why We Chose This Idea
We wanted to build an app that directly benefits students like us. StudySync combines useful tools — a Pomodoro timer, motivational quotes, flashcards, and music — in one platform. It fits the course requirements (API usage, RecyclerView, multiple user actions) while remaining practical and meaningful.
